# TelephonyScaffolding 

This repository contains a simple scaffolding application to support development of the TMQTelephony framework.

Ensure that your source tree is configured as follows:
```
..
|
|_ TMQTelephony
|_ TelephonyScaffolding
|_ ...
|
...
```

This application depends on `TMQTelephony` to provide all the actual functionality, save for some supporting settings that cannot be configured in a framework.

Just build and run :)
